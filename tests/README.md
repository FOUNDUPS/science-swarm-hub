## Phase 0 PoC Tests

Minimum acceptance tests for Phase 0:

1. **Contract creation**: All four contracts can be instantiated
2. **Deterministic IDs**: Same inputs produce same IDs
3. **Status transitions**: Valid status values accepted
4. **Score clamping**: ContributionRecord.score stays in [0.0, 1.0]

## Integration Tests (Phase 1)

- Integration with pqn_alignment detector
- Integration with moltbook_distribution_adapter
- Persistence roundtrip tests
